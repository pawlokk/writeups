this one wasnt fun 

part 1:

didnt even enumerate much, ran nmap with default scripts, sqlmap on some stuff i thought would be injectable and nikto on the page in general, look through source and read /robots.txt 

walking the app:

pretty basic site, login pane screams at us, 

bruteforced it guessing some pretty default usernames (pennywise theme, but used admin)

for passwords i used rockyou.txt, bruteforced it with ZAP as burp wont load rockyou 

admin:1qaz2wsx 

then, after looking up blog management system, which was [BlogEngine.NET](http://BlogEngine.NET) 3.3.6, it turned out that exploit-db has a script that gets us a reverse shell 

part 2:

pivoting to meterpreter 

generate payload with msfvenom, pretty basic stuff 

windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp  just like in other windows machines

upload it to C:\Windows\Temp using powershell wget and python webserver 

set up multi/handler, and run the executable within our shell 

part 3:

priv esc 

winPEAS.bat uploaded throught meterpreter, where we could find Scheduler service software running as system with a writeable folder 

it came down to generating a reverse shell and uploading it as .exe of the service
