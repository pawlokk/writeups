this was one quick and easy

nmap reveals ports 80, 135, 139, 435, 3389 

site on port 80 doesnt reveal anything, nikto, gobuster - no output 

key points of the CTF:

enumerating samba 

`nmap —script=smb* -p 139,435 TARGETIP -v`

`smbclient -L //TARGETIP/`

this, and nmap script reveals below shares:

Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
C$                    Disk      Default share
IPC$                 IPC       Remote IPC
nt4wrksv          Disk

then,

smbclient \\\\10.10.4.134\\nt4wrksv

reveals passwords.txt which has 2 base64 encoded strings inside, that reveal below credentials:

**Bob - !P@$$W0rD!123** 

**Bill - Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$**

after discovering credentials and running:

`nmap —script=vuln TARGETIP -v` 

reveals that smb is vulnerable to MS-17-010, eternalblue 

exploiting this with metasploit is very easy, however usual exploit “**windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue”** 

wouldn’t work, so i used 

**“windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec”** 

instead, got a meterpreter system shell, which allowed me to grab user and root flag and complete the challenge
