this was a medium diff tryhackme room 

enumeration showed open ssh, http, and samba 

port 80 hosted a wordpress site which i started my enumeration with 

standard enumeration; nikto, gobuster, manually reviewing source codes, burp traffic didnt show much, so i decided to go with wp-enum and wp-scan

[https://github.com/TheNittam/wp-enum](https://github.com/TheNittam/wp-enum)

wp-scan was preinstalled on kali 

this showed potential usernames, which i used to bruteforce the login pane using OWASP ZAP

credentials revealed to be kwheel:cutiepie1 

this allowed me to use `CVE-2019-89242 | CVE-2019-89242`

[Offensive Security's Exploit Database Archive](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49512)

through metasploit, this is how i got my initial shell 

after this came enumeration, i checked nopasswd sudo entries, readability of crucial files, mysql database using credentials found in wordpress config files. Mysql contained password hashes that proved to be a rabbit hole, hence i couldn’t crack them with hashcat and further steps didn’t require them 

upon reviewing binaries with SUID set, i found a script called checker in /usr/sbin directory 

the script upon running output only one string

“Not an admin” 

after inspecting it with 

`ltrace checker` 

it turned out that the script checks for a environment variable called admin

`export admin=1`

allowed me to execute the script successfully, and as it had SUID set i got a root shell and was able to retrieve both the flags
